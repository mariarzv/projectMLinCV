using yolov5

Test image inference and video inference

## Prerequisites

 - Needs Python to run, tested with Python 3.9
 - Needs pip to run pip install commands, to check if you have pip run `py -m pip --version`
 - If you installed Python from source, with an installer from python.org, or via Homebrew you should already have pip. If youâ€™re on Linux and installed using your OS package manager, you may have to install pip separately, see [installing pip/setuptools/wheel with Linux Package Managers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/)
 - Needs poetry installed in order to manage environments, on Windows installation is: `(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -` or other versions of this command for your operating system.  
 - You can check if you have poetry installed: `poetry --version`

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your folder and create poetry virtual environment `poetry env use python 3.9` or other Python version you have, to check your version run `python --version`
2. Make sure you have poetry-core installed: `pip install poetry-core`
3. To install the project directly from repository use `pip install git+https://github.com/mariarzv/projectMLinCV.git@assignment1`  or if that doesn't work you can clone or download the repository and install the package directly from dist folder:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
2. Run `cd dist` and `pip install projectmlincv-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` to install the project using the wheel file. If project is already installed with the same version as the provided wheel you can use --force-reinstall to force an installation of the wheel.

## Running

To run the project, navigate to demo.py directory and run `python demo.py`. This will grab an image and save the inference result in the images folder.
